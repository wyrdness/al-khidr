## Description

Al-Khidr (also Al-Khadir, Al-Khidhr, Al-Khader; الخضر "The Green One") is one of the most enigmatic and widely venerated figures in Islamic tradition and broader Middle Eastern folklore. Described as an immortal sage, prophet, or saint with special knowledge from God, Al-Khidr appears in the Quran (Surah Al-Kahf) as a mysterious teacher who instructs the prophet Moses in divine wisdom through seemingly paradoxical actions.

Al-Khidr is believed to have drunk from the Fountain of Life, gaining immortality, and to wander the earth helping those in distress, particularly travelers, sailors, and the lost. He appears dressed in green robes, often manifesting at moments of crisis to provide guidance, rescue, or miraculous intervention. His cult spans the Islamic world from Morocco to Indonesia, with shrines, festivals, and devotional practices dedicated to him, and he is revered by Sunni, Shi'a, and Sufi Muslims alike, as well as by some Christians, Jews, and syncretic traditions.

The figure of Al-Khidr represents divine mercy, hidden knowledge, mystical wisdom, and the mysterious workings of Providence. His actions often confound conventional morality, teaching that divine wisdom transcends human understanding. He embodies the idea that God's plans may appear cruel or irrational but ultimately serve higher purposes invisible to mortals.

## Quranic and Islamic Tradition

### Quranic Account (Surah Al-Kahf 18:60-82)

**Moses and the Servant of God**
The foundational story:

Moses tells his companion Joshua he will not stop traveling until he reaches "the junction of the two seas." They forget their fish, which comes alive and swims away - a sign they've reached their destination.

They encounter a servant of God (not named in Quran, identified as Al-Khidr in hadith) whom God has granted special knowledge. Moses asks to follow and learn. The servant warns Moses won't be able to bear witnessing his actions without explanation. Moses promises patience.

**Three Paradoxical Acts**

1. **The Boat**: Damages a boat belonging to poor fishermen
   - Moses objects: Why damage what belongs to poor people?
   - Later explained: A tyrannical king was seizing all boats; damage made it unseizable

2. **The Boy**: Kills a young boy they encounter
   - Moses horrified: Innocent life taken!
   - Later explained: Boy would have caused parents grief through disbelief; God would replace with better child

3. **The Wall**: Repairs wall in unwelcoming town without payment
   - Moses questions: Why work for free for inhospitable people?
   - Later explained: Treasure beneath belonged to orphans; wall protected it until they matured

**Lessons**
- Divine wisdom transcends human understanding
- Apparent evil may serve higher good
- Human knowledge is limited
- Patience required to comprehend divine will
- Hidden mercy in seeming harshness
